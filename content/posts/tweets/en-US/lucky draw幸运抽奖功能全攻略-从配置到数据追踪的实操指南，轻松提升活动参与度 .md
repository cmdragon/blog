In various events, live streaming, and promotional scenarios, fair and controllable lottery segments are key to boosting participation. As a fully-featured advanced lottery tool, **Lucky Draw** has become the preferred solution for corporate event planning and marketing promotion with its professional-level lottery functions and data management capabilities. This article will provide a detailed introduction to using Lucky Draw, covering feature analysis, scenario applications, and operation steps to help you efficiently carry out various lottery activities.

### Part 1: Lucky Draw Core Feature Analysis - Making Lotteries More Professional and Controllable

#### 1. Precise Lottery Configuration: Custom Weights and Guaranteed Winner Lists

Lucky Draw supports **custom weight control**, allowing flexible adjustment of winning probabilities for different participants based on prize value and activity goals (e.g., setting lower weights for high-value prizes to increase scarcity). Additionally, for special groups like VIP customers and partners, you can directly preset winners through the "guaranteed winner list system" to ensure key demographics receive exclusive benefits, avoiding interference from randomness.

#### 2. Data Visualization: Real-Time Statistics Dashboard

During activities, the **professional statistics dashboard** displays participation numbers, winning probability distributions, and remaining prize quantities in real-time, supporting dynamic data tracking and analysis. Whether it's real-time data adjustments during live streaming lotteries or result reviews after offline events, you can quickly grasp the situation through the visualization interface, facilitating timely optimization of activity strategies.

#### 3. Multi-Scenario Adaptation: Full Process Support from Lottery to Promotion

Lucky Draw includes **multiple lottery modes** (such as random lottery, timed lottery, weighted lottery, grouped lottery, etc.) that can adapt to different scenarios like live streaming interaction, annual celebration events, team workshops, and marketing activities. For example: using "real-time lottery" mode in live streaming to enhance audience participation, or using "custom winner count" in promotional activities to precisely control distribution节奏 and avoid resource waste.

#### 4. Convenient Data Management: Excel Import and Multi-Language Support

When participant information is complex, Lucky Draw supports **Excel file batch import** to quickly integrate customer, employee, or fan data; simultaneously, the "prize management" function allows customization of prize levels, images, and redemption rules. The multi-language interface (supporting Chinese, English, and other languages) meets the needs of cross-border activities or international teams.

In live streaming scenarios, using Lucky Draw's "real-time lottery" mode combined with "random lottery + weight settings":
