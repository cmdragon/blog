Struggling with file transfers between your phone and computer? Bluetooth feels like a snail’s pace, WeChat/QQ imposes file size limits, and cable connections seem overly complicated? Enter Snapdrop (https://tools.cmdragon.cn/zh/apps/snapdrop), a cross-device file transfer tool designed to eliminate these pain points. It requires no client installation—simply use your browser to seamlessly share files between mobile and computer. Easy, secure, and efficient, it’s the ideal solution for everyday photo, document, and video transfers in both work and personal settings.  

### Why Choose Snapdrop?  

Snapdrop’s core strengths lie in its "zero configuration, cross-platform, and secure speed." Operating entirely via a web interface, any device—phone, computer, or tablet—can open a browser, visit the designated URL, and automatically detect other devices on the same local network. No device pairing or account registration is needed. Files transfer directly between local devices without cloud storage, ensuring privacy and eliminating size or distance restrictions. As long as your phone and computer share the same Wi-Fi network, file transfers are effortless.  

### Step-by-Step Guide: Cross-Device File Transfer  

#### Step 1: Ensure Devices Share the Same Network  
Both your phone (Android/iOS) and computer (Windows/Mac) must connect to the same Wi-Fi network. Snapdrop relies on local network discovery—devices on different networks cannot detect each other. Confirm this setup first.  

#### Step 2: Access Snapdrop’s Web Interface  
- **On Mobile**: Open a browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.), enter https://tools.cmdragon.cn/zh/apps/snapdrop, and input a device name. Your phone will auto-detect nearby Snapdrop devices.  
- **On Computer**: Open a browser, enter the same URL. The page loads automatically, displaying "Searching for devices."  

> If devices aren’t detected, refresh the page.  

#### Step 3: Establish Connection and Transfer Files  
1. **Device Pairing**: On the same network, both devices display each other’s names (e.g., "Xiaoming’s iPhone," "Office Laptop"). Tap the target device name to initiate a connection.  
2. **Select Files**: For phone-to-computer transfer, tap "Select File" on your phone, choose files from your gallery or file manager (supports images, documents, videos, etc.), then tap "Send."  
3. **Confirm Reception**: The computer shows a pop-up with file details (type, size, sender). Tap "Save" to complete the transfer. For multiple files, repeat steps 2–3 and confirm each file on the receiver.  

#### Step 4: Automatic Cleanup After Transfer  
No files are saved locally after successful transfer. The receiver leaves no residual files, and the sender shows no "sent" status—ensuring a clean, privacy-protected experience.  

### Pro Tips & Important Notes  

1. **Network Stability**: Ensure stable Wi-Fi signals on both devices to prevent transfer interruptions.  
2. **Device Compatibility**: Works with all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox) and supports iOS/Android—no device restrictions.  
3. **File Size**: While no explicit limit exists, keep single files under 100MB for reliability. Large files can be split into batches.  
4. **Temporary Network Switching**: For cross-network transfers, share your phone’s hotspot with your computer or connect directly to the target network.
