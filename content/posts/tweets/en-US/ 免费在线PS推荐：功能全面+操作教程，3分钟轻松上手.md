New to the tool? Follow this step-by-step beginner’s guide:

### **Core Operations: Master the Interface in 3 Minutes**

1. **Create a Canvas**: After accessing the tool, click "New," set dimensions (e.g., 1080×1920 pixels for social media), choose background color (transparent or solid), then click "OK" to start.
2. **Import Assets**: Click "Upload Image" on the left to select local files or import from cloud storage. For text, click the "Text Tool" (T icon) to add content, then adjust font, size, and color.
3. **Core Tools**: The left toolbar includes selection tools (quick area selection), brush tool (for sketching or precision edits), and eraser (to remove unwanted elements)—all drag-and-drop for basic editing.

### **Advanced Techniques: From "Cutout" to "AI Enhancement"**
